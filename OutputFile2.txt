RUIN HAS COME TO OUR FAMILY.

YOU REMEMBER OUR VENERABLE HOUSE, OPULENT AND IMPERIAL, GAZING PROUDLY FROM ITS STOIC PERCH ABOVE THE MOOR.

I LIVED ALL MY YEARS IN THAT ANCIENT RUMOR-SHADOWED MANOR, FATTENED BY DECADENCE AND LUXURY. AND YET, I BEGAN TO TIRE OF...CONVENTIONAL EXTRAVAGANCE. SINGULAR UNSETTLING TALES SUGGESTED THE MANSION 
ITSELF WAS A GATEWAY TO SOME FABULOUS AND UNNAMEABLE POWER.

WITH RELIC AND RITUAL, I BENT EVERY EFFORT TOWARDS THE EXCAVATION AND RECOVERY OF THOSE LONG BURIED SECRETS, EXHAUSTING WHAT REMAINED OF OUR FAMILY FORTUNE ON...SWARTHY WORKMEN AND...STURDY SHOVELS.
AT LAST, IN THE SALT-SOAKED CRAGS BENEATH THE LOWEST FOUNDATIONS, WE UNEARTHED THAT DAMNABLE PORTAL OF ANTEDILUVIAN EVIL. OUR EVERY STEP UNSETTLED THE ANCIENT EARTH, BUT WE WERE IN A REALM OF DEATH 
AND MADNESS! IN THE END, I ALONE FLED, LAUGHING AND WAILING, THROUGH THOSE BLACKENED ARCADES OF ANTIQUITY, UNTIL CONSCIOUSNESS FAILED ME.
